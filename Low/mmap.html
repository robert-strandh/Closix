<H3>Description</H3>


<P>
  <tt>mmap</tt> creates a new mapping in the virtual address space of
  the calling process.  The starting address for the new mapping is
  specified in <i>preferred-address</i>.  The <i>length</i> argument
  specifies the length of the mapping.
</P>

<P>
  If <i>preferred-address</i> is <tt>nil</tt>, then the kernel chooses
  the address at which to create the mapping; this is the most
  portable method of creating a new mapping.
  If <i>preferred-address</i> is not <tt>nil</tt>, then the kernel
  takes it as a hint about where to place the mapping; on Linux, the
  mapping will be created at a nearby page boundary.  The address of
  the new mapping is returned as the result of the call.
</P>

<P>
  The contents of a file mapping (as opposed to an anonymous mapping;
  see <a href="map-anonymous.html">+map-anonymous+</a>), are initialized
  using <i>length</i> bytes starting at offset <i>offset</i> in the
  file (or other object) referred to by the file
  descriptor <i>file-descriptor</i>.  The argument <i>offset</i> must
  be a multiple of the page size.
</P>

<P>
  The <i>protection</i> argument describes the desired memory
  protection of the mapping (and must not conflict with the open mode
  of the file).  It is either <a href="prot-none.html">+prot-none+</a>
  or the bitwise <tt>or</tt> of one or more of the following flags:
</P>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="prot-exec.html">+prot-exec+</a></td>
    <td>
      <P>
	Pages may be executed.
      </P>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="prot-read.html">+prot-read+</a></td>
    <td>
      <P>
	Pages may be read.
      </P>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="prot-write.html">+prot-write+</a></td>
    <td>
      <P>
	Pages may be written.
      </P>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="prot-none.html">+prot-none+</a></td>
    <td>
      <P>
	Pages may not be accessed.
      </P>
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>


<P>
  The <i>flags</i> argument determines whether updates to the mapping
  are visible to other processes mapping the same region, and whether
  updates are carried through to the underlying file.  This behavior
  is determined by including exactly one of the following values in
  flags:
</P>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="map-shared.html">+map-shared+</a></td>
    <td>
      <P>
	Share this mapping.  Updates to the mapping are visible to
        other processes that map this file, and are carried through to
        the underlying file.  The file may not actually be updated
        until <a href="msync.html">msync</a>
        or <a href="munmap.html">munmap</a> is called.
      </P>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="map-private.html">+map-private+</a></td>
    <td>
      <P>
	Create a private copy-on-write mapping.  Updates to the
        mapping are not visible to other processes mapping the same
        file, and are not carried through to the underlying file.  It
        is unspecified whether changes made to the file after the
        <tt>mmap</tt> call are visible in the mapped region.
      </P>
    </td>
  </tr>

<P>
  Both of these flags are described in POSIX.1-2001.

  In addition, zero or more of the following values can be ORed in flags:

<P>
  Of the above flags, only <a href="map-fixed.html">+map-fixed+</a> is
  specified in POSIX.1-2001.  However, most systems also support
  <a href="map-anonymous.html">+map-anonymous+</a> (or its
 synonym <a href="map-anon.html">+map-anon+</a>).
</P>

<P>
  Some systems document the additional
  flags <a href="map-autogrow.html">+map-autogrow+</a>, 
  <a href="map-autoresrv.html">+map-autoresrv+</a>,
  <a href="map-copy.html">+map-copy+</a>,
  and <a href="map-local..html">+map-local+</a>.
</P>

<P>
  Memory mapped by <tt>mmap</tt> is preserved
  across <a href="fork.html">fork</a> with the same attributes.
</P>

<P>
  A file is mapped in multiples of the page size.  For a file that is
  not a multiple of the page size, the remaining memory is zeroed when
  mapped, and writes to that region are not written out to the file.
  The effect of changing the size of the underlying file of a mapping
  on the pages that correspond to added or removed regions of the file
  is unspecified.
